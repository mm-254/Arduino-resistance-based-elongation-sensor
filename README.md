# Arduino-resistance-based-elongation-sensor
Reads Analog voltage at two terminals of Wheatstone Bridge (Vc, Vd), Varies Resistance in digital potentiometer, computes elongation percentage 

Reads resistance on digital potentiometer, Calculates Rx when Vc=Vd.
Rx should be across an elastic conducting material of some sort, where resistance varies in proportion to elongation.
